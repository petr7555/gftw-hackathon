Throughout the April, 2020, there was a hackathon running on [DEV](https://dev.to/devteam/announcing-the-twilio-hackathon-on-dev-2lh8).
It was concerned with using Twilio communication API to build various stuff.
I was one of the participants. You can see my submission [here](https://dev.to/petr7555/twiliohackathon-autopilot-node-js-postgresql-3p09). 
I really enjoyed it, so when another hackathon was announced shortly after the first one ended, I was very happy and I decided I will give it a try.

The [Grant For The Web Hackathon on DEV](https://dev.to/devteam/announcing-the-grant-for-the-web-hackathon-on-dev-3kd1) is about Web Monetization. Users can send micro payments to content creators and they can reward them for example by unlocking a bonus content in return. This is possible thanks to the new [JavaScript API](https://webmonetization.org/docs/api). We will explore this API in further posts.
